## Introduction
This repo keeps the projects which were taught in the book, [*deep learning
with Python*]().

## Concepts
In this section, we summarize the concepts which I found very insightful in the
book.

*machine learning*: "searching for a useful representations of some input data,
within a predefined space of possibilities, using guidance from a feedback
signal."

*loss function (objective function)*: the quantity that will be minimized during
training. It represents a measure of success for the task at hand.

*optimizer*: determine how the network (weights) will be updated based on the
loss function. It implements a specific variants of stochastic gradient descent
(SGD).
